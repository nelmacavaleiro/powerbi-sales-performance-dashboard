# Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard (2019–2023)

This project presents an interactive **Power BI sales performance dashboard** analysing revenue, profit, costs, and units sold across multiple countries and products between **2019 and 2023**.

The dashboard was built to demonstrate **data modelling, DAX fundamentals, visual design, and business insight generation** using a clean, business-focused reporting layout.

# Key Insights

- **The United Kingdom and France are the most profitable markets**, contributing the largest share of overall profit.
- **Germany records comparatively high unit sales but lower profit**, suggesting reduced margins or higher operational costs.
- **Chilli and Cheese & Onion are the top-selling products by volume**, though strong sales volume does not always translate into higher profitability.
- **Profit peaked in 2020 (£0.94M)**, followed by a significant decline in 2022 and a partial recovery in 2023.
- **Sales volume alone is not a reliable performance indicator**, reinforcing the importance of profit-led decision-making.
